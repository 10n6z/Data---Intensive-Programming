# Data-Intensive Programming Exercises & Projects

This repository contains the **exercises** and **projects** completed for the **Data-Intensive Programming** course at **Tampere University**.

---

##  Repository Structure

- **Exercises/**  
  Contains course assignments focused on foundational concepts in data-intensive programming. These may include algorithmic tasks, data processing exercises, or hands-on coding assignments.

- **Projects/**  
  Contains larger-scale, self-contained projects applying data-intensive programming techniques. These may involve real-world data sets, performance optimizations, or interactive applications.

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Scala** â€“ Appears to be the primary language (â‰ˆ50% of the codebase)
- **Python** â€“ Also heavily used (â‰ˆ47% of the code)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ Likely used for exploratory data analysis or interactive demonstrations (â‰ˆ3%)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Descriptions

### Exercises
- **Exercise 1 â€“ Data Processing Basics**  
  Learn to manipulate collections, perform transformations, and implement simple algorithms in Scala/Python.  

- **Exercise 2 â€“ Parallelism**  
  Use parallel collections and concurrency constructs to speed up computation on large datasets.  

- **Exercise 3 â€“ File & Data Formats**  
  Parse structured data (CSV, JSON) and implement simple aggregations.  

- **Exercise 4 â€“ Distributed Data Processing**  
  Introduction to MapReduce and Spark, implementing word count and other classic tasks.  

- *(add more based on your repo content)*  

### Final Project
The final project applies the course concepts to a larger data-intensive problem, such as:  
- Analyzing a real-world dataset (e.g., logs, social media, sensor data).  
- Implementing efficient data pipelines for ETL (Extractâ€“Transformâ€“Load).  
- Using Spark/parallel algorithms for large-scale analysis.  
- Presenting findings in a short report or notebook.
